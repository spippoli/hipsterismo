This simple application in openframeworks takes a mov file or the webcam feed and processes it to create polygon graphics.
In the future I'd like to add the ability to process a still image.

The code depends on the following addons:

* ofxCv 
* ofxDelaunay 
* ofxGui
* ofxMSACore
* ofxMSAInterpolator
* ofxOpenCv
* ofxXmlSettings
